# simple_game_python
A simple, modular, script for a basic invaders-esque game largely using python's pygame module.

Made to test knowledge of class, function, and module development developed using Eric Matthes' Python Crash Course book.

Run using alien_invasion.py through a scripting window such a spyder.

If directory troubles occur try import os; os.chdir(somedirectory) where somedirectory is the directory containing alien_invasion.py.
